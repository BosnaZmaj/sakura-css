                    <h2>10. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
                    <h3>10.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
                    <p>Before filing a claim, you agree to contact us at legal@sakurabudget.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve disputes in good faith within 30 days.</p>

                    <h3>10.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
                    <p>If informal resolution fails, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's Consumer Arbitration Rules, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>

                    <h3>10.3 Arbitration Procedures</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The arbitration will be conducted in the state where you reside or another mutually agreeable location</li>
                        <li>The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding</li>
                        <li>Each party will bear their own costs and attorneys' fees unless the arbitrator determines otherwise</li>
                        <li>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>10.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
                    <p><strong>YOU AND SAKURA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Unless both you and Sakura agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

                    <h3>10.5 Opt-Out Right</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to opt out of arbitration. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by sending an email to legal@sakurabudget.com with "Arbitration Opt-Out" in the subject line and including your name, address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration. Opting out of arbitration will not affect your ability to use the Services.</p>

                    <h3>10.6 Governing Law</h3>
                    <p>These Terms and any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
